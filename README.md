Symfony Demo Application
========================

The demo app consists of a backend to manage blog posts and a frontend to show them.

Additionally, there are certain workloads that have to be done in the background for 
which the symfony/messenger component is used. The demo app has a typical symfony cli which can be used
to generate and consume work messages.
